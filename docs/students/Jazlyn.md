Hello there! I am a rising sophmore, I just finsihed my freshmen year at Delaware State University. My favorite space entity are black holes, I like how mysterious they are.

Fun (not so fun) fact: I have never coded before, so this is my first time ever doing something like this. Its hard but pretty cool.
